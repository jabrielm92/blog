# blog

A personal blog i'm building using Python/Flask
Consists of 2 pages and a sub page so far. A blog page and an admin dashboard. 
The admin dashboard allows me to create/edit/delete posts.
Posts can be text, img, video, or a combination of the 3.
Edit post has is own page where the specific post is called to be edited.
