# blog

A personal blog i'm building using Python/Flask
Consists of 2 pages and a sub page so far. A blog page and an admin dashboard. 
The admin dashboard allows me to create/edit/delete posts.
Posts can be text, img, video, or a combination of the 3.
Edit post has is own page where the specific post is called to be edited.

blog page: https://blog-kfuy.onrender.com/blog
admin dashboard: https://blog-kfuy.onrender.com/admin_dashboard

feel free to test them out. admin dash is enabled for create/edit/delete
for the time being until i begin to utilize personally. Just wanted
to show some new work. Any questions or additions or comments, feel 
free to use the admin dash to create one. Thanks JM
